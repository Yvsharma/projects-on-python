    "Consider a software for maintaining records of the students in a class. Consider the following functions which are required to be performed:\n",

    "Sorting of names according to First Name of the students.\n",
    "Finding the Minimum marks among all the marks\n",
    "Finding contact number of student using his/her First Name.\n",
    "The task is to write a Python program to implement the software having these three functionalities.\n",

    "Approach: For the above problem we should use a dictionary that either takes a name as a whole to key and other data as value to it or vice versa. Here I have taken the name as a key and contact number, marks as the value associated with the name. So at first the user needs to enter the details of the students and these details will be stored in dictionary as {[‘first name’, ‘second name’]:(‘contact number’, ‘marks’)}. Then we create a new list of tuples that store data according to the function requirement. In the program four user-defined functions have been created:\n",
    "\n",
    "sort( ) function that sorts the record based on the first name.\n",
    "minmarks( ) function that finds the minimum marks from all records.\n",
    "searchdetail( ) function that takes first name as an input and fetch student contact number from the corresponding record.\n",
    "option() function for showing the options.\n",
